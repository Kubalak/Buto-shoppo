Something should be here but we will deal with it later ;)

`git clone git@github.com:Kubalak/Buto-shoppo.git`<br/>

`npm i`<br/>
After installation is finished create new `.env` file and set it up:
`API_HOST=` - Host addres e.g. `google.com`<br/>
`API_URL=` - Url under which API is located e.g. `api/butto`<br/>

Threre you go ❤️!
